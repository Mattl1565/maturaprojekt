1) Detecting the order of the cars + overtaking
- new car gets detected -> add car.ID + coords to AllCars (list)                                    âœ“
- make sure to save the visible cars in a list (VisibleCars)
- VisibleCars gets sorted by car.Y axes, because we look at the cars from the front
- if the AllCars gets changed, the cars have to be repositioned and a overtake has been detected
- if a car drives out of the screen, it gets removed from the AllCars list

2) Determine wheter the cars drive away from us or towards us
- FOR MATTL TO THINK ABOUT: IS THIS EVEN NECESSARY? IF YES WHY? IF NO WHY NOT? my brain couldnt work it out yet
